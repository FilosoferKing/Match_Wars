##Features
* *Duel of Fates* theme music during play. (optional)
* Lightsaber sound effects during play on card click. 
* X-Wing and Death Star animation depending on match or miss.
* Card randomization on each new game.
* Authentic Star Wars inspired end credit crawl.

##Project Notes
  * The most fun and challenging aspect of this project was using the offset() function 
    to calculate the position of the red laser in opposition to the Death Star so the
    laser would not pass the target when it moved forward with each new card match.
  * I enjoyed using CSS animation to rotate the cards creating the flip motion. Since there
    were two cards stacked creating a back and face, timing was critical in making the flip seemless.
  * My favorite aspect of the game is the end credit crawl and the fighter jet animation. It was 
    a challenge to manipulate the end credit text to have the Star Wars feel to it. I also 
    enjoyed animating the fighter jet using jQuery animation to make it feel like it is flying towards you.
